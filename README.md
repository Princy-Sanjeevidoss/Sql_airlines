#  Airline Booking & Revenue SQL Analytics Project

This project demonstrates how SQL is used to solve **real-world airline business problems**. I created a relational database, inserted sample data (using foreign names), and wrote meaningful analytical queries to derive insights such as customer behavior, booking patterns, revenue tracking, and feedback sentiment.

##  Project Goal

To simulate an airline management system that helps:
- Track completed and cancelled bookings
- Measure total revenue and loss
- Analyze customer feedback
- Find repeat customers
- Identify high-performing and low-performing flights

---

##  Tools Used

- **MySQL Workbench** – To design schema and run queries
- **GitHub** – To store and present the project

---

##  SQL Queries Included

Below are the real-world queries implemented in this project:

1. **Customers who completed a flight**  
   → Lists customers whose booking status is marked as 'Completed'.

2. **Total revenue earned per flight**  
   → Calculates total earnings per flight based on completed bookings.

3. **Number of flights that were cancelled**  
   → Counts all bookings with 'Cancelled' status.

4. **Average rating for each flight**  
   → Groups feedback by flight and computes average ratings.

5. **Number of bookings per day**  
   → Shows daily booking trends to analyze peak days.

6. **Most popular destination**  
   → Identifies top destinations based on booking count.

7. **Total revenue loss due to cancellations**  
   → Estimates revenue loss by multiplying cancelled bookings with flight price.

8. **Flights that caused the most cancellation losses**  
   → Highlights flights with the highest loss due to cancellations.

9. **Customer repeat booking behavior**  
   → Finds customers who made more than one booking.

10. **Feedback summary with sentiment-like filtering**  
    → Categorizes feedback into Positive, Neutral, and Negative using ratings.

##  Real-World Impact

These queries simulate how **data analysts in airline companies** work to:
- Improve flight efficiency
- Increase customer satisfaction
- Reduce cancellation loss
- Detect booking trends
- Enhance customer loyalty

This is a beginner-friendly yet practical project that shows how SQL helps business decision-making in the airline industry.
